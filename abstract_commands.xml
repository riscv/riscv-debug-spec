        \begin{steps}{Perform the following sequence of operations:}
        \item Halt the hart, if \Fprehalt is set. If the hart is already
            handled, the entire command fails.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \Fpreexec is set.
        \item Copy data from the register specified by \Fregno into {\tt data}, if \Fwrite is clear.
        \item Copy data from {\tt data} into the register specified by \Fregno, if \Fwrite is set.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \Fpostexec is set.
        \item Resume the hart, if \Fpostresume is set. If the hart is already
            running, the entire command fails.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \Fcmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed.

        This command must be implemented and support accessing GPRs when the
        hart is halted. Accessing other registers, or accessing registers while
        the hart is running is optional.

            When 1, halt the hart before performing the rest of the command.

        <field name="size" bits="21:19">
            2: Access the lowest 32 bits of the register.

            3: Access the lowest 64 bits of the register.

            4: Access the lowest 128 bits of the register.

            If \Fsize specifies a size larger than the register is, then the
            access must fail. If a register is accessible, then \Fsize matching
            the register's actual size must be supported.
