\chapter{Bug Fixes}

\section{0.13.1}

Since the ratification of 0.13, the following bugs have been fixed in 0.13.1:

\subsection{Resume ack bit is set after resuming}

The third paragraph of Section 3.5 has a mistake. At the end of the process
described there, the resume ack bit is \emph{set}.

\subsection{\Faamsize does not affect Argument Width}

The Argument Width of the Access Memory abstract command defined in Section
3.7.1.3 is determined by DXLEN, and not by \Faamsize.

\subsection{\Rsbdatazero Reads Order of Operations}

The order of operations listed in Section 3.12.23, describing reads from
\Rsbdatazero, is incorrect. It should read:

\begin{steps}{Reads from this register start the following:}
    \item ``Return'' the data.
    \item Set \Fsbbusy.
    \item If \Fsbreadondata is set, perform another system bus read.
    \item If \Fsbautoincrement is set, increment {\tt sbaddress}.
    \item Clear \Fsbbusy.
\end{steps}

\subsection{Hart reset behavior when \Fhaltreq is set}

When a hart comes out of reset and \Fhaltreq is set, the hart will immediately
enter Debug Mode.

\subsection{\Fmte only applies when action=0}

The definition of \Fmte in Section 5.2.6 should state that \Fmte only affects
triggers whose action is 0.

\subsection{\Fsselect applies to \Fsvalue}

In Section 5.2.13, when \Fsselect is 0 it ignores \Fsvalue.

\subsection{Last trigger example}

In the last example in Section B.9, the value for \Rtdatatwo 1 should be
0xefff8675.

\section{0.13.2}

Fixed a formatting issue that caused step 1 in the Quick Access description to
be missing from the document.
