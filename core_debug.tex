\chapter{RISC-V Debug}
\label{sec:core_debug}

Modifications to the RISC-V core to support debug are kept to a minimum.  There
is a special execution mode (Debug Mode) and a few extra CSRs. The DM takes care
of the rest.

\section{Debug Mode} \label{debugmode}

Debug Mode is a special processor mode used only when the core is halted for
external debugging. How Debug Mode is implemented is not specified here.

\begin{steps}{When executing code from the Program Buffer, the processor stays
    in Debug Mode and the following apply:}
\item All operations are executed at machine mode privilege level.
\item \Fmprv in \Rmstatus is ignored.
\item All interrupts are masked.
\item Exceptions don't update any registers.  That includes {\tt cause}, {\tt
    epc}, {\tt badaddr}, {\tt dpc}, and \Rmstatus. They do end execution of the
    Program Buffer.
\item No action is taken if a trigger matches.
\item Trace is disabled.
\item Counters may be stopped, depending on \Fstopcount in \Rdcsr.
\item Timers may be stopped, depending on \Fstoptime in \Rdcsr.
\item The {\tt wfi} instruction acts as a {\tt nop}.
\item Almost all instructions that change the privilege level have undefined
    behavior.  This includes {\tt ecall}, {\tt mret}, {\tt hret}, {\tt sret},
    and {\tt uret}.  (To change the privilege level, the debugger can write
    \Fprv in \Rdcsr). The only exception is {\tt ebreak}. When that is executed
    in Debug Mode, it halts the processor again but without updating \Rdpc or \Rdcsr.
\end{steps}

\section{Load-Reserved/Store-Conditional Instructions}

The reservation registered by an {\tt lr} instruction on a memory address may
be lost when entering Debug Mode or while in Debug Mode.  This means that there
may be no forward progress if Debug Mode is entered between {\tt lr} and {\tt
sc} pairs.

\section{Reset}

If the halt signal is asserted when a core comes out of reset, the core must
enter Debug Mode before executing any instructions, but after performing any
initialization that would usually happen before the first instruction is
executed.

\subsection{{\tt dret} Instruction} \label{dret}

To return from Debug Mode, a new instruction is defined: {\tt dret}. It has an
encoding of 0x7b200073. On harts which support this instruction,
executing {\tt dret} in Debug Mode changes \Rpc to the value
stored in \Rdpc. The current privilege level is changed to that specified by
\Fprv in \Rdcsr. The hart is no longer in debug mode.

It is not necessary for the debugger to know whether an implementation supports
{\tt dret}, as the Debug Module will ensure that it is executed if necessary.
It is defined in this specification only to reserve the opcode and
allow for reusable Debug Module implementations.

\section{Core Debug Registers} \label{debreg}

The supported Core Debug Registers must be implemented for each hart that can
be debugged.

\section{Virtual Debug Registers} \label{virtreg}

Virtual debug registers are a requirement on the debugger SW/interface,
not on the Core designer.
