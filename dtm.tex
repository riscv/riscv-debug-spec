\section{Debug Transport Module (DTM)}
\label{sec:dtm}

Debug Transport Modules provide access to the DM over one or more transports
(eg. JTAG or USB).

There may be multiple DTMs in a single platform. Ideally every component that
communicates with the outside world includes a DTM, allowing a platform to be
debugged through every transport it supports.  For instance a USB component
could include a DTM. This would trivially allow any platform to be debugged
over USB. All that is required is that the USB module already in use also has
access to the Debug Bus.

Using multiple DTMs at the same time is not supported. It is left to the user
to ensure this does not happen.
