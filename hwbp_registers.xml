<registers name="Trigger Registers" prefix="CSR_">
    The trigger registers are only accessible in machine and Halt Mode to
    prevent untrusted user code from causing entry into Halt Mode without the
    OS's permission.

    <register name="Trigger Select" short="tselect" address="0x7a0">
        This register determines which trigger is accessible through the other
        trigger registers. The set of accessible triggers must start at 0, and
        be contiguous.

        Writes of values greater than or equal to the number of supported
        triggers may result in a different value in this register than what was
        written.  Debuggers should read back the value to confirm that what
        they wrote was a valid index.

        Since triggers can be used both by Halt Mode and M Mode, the debugger
        must restore this register if it modifies it.

        This register is accessible as \Rtdataone when \Ftype is 2.

        Writing unsupported values to any field in this register results in the
        reset value being written instead. When a debugger wants to use a
        feature, it must write the appropriate value and then read back the
        register to determine whether it is supported.

        Address and data trigger implementation are heavily dependent on how
        the processor core is implemented. To accommodate various
        implementations, load and store address and data triggers may fire at
        whatever point in time is most convenient for the implementation.
        Following the suggestions in the definitions of \Fstore and \Fload will
        lead to the best user experience, however.

            number of bytes in that range.  A value of 0 indicates that only
            exact value matches are supported (one byte range). A value of 63
            corresponds to the maximum NAPOT range, which is $2^{63}$ bytes in
            size.

        <field name="timing" bits="18" access="R/W" reset="0">
            0: The action for this trigger will be taken just before the

            instructions are are committed.

            1: The action for this trigger will be taken after the instruction
            that triggered it is executed. It should be taken before the next
            instruction is executed, but it is better to implement triggers and
            not implement that suggestion than to not implement them at all.

            Most hardware will only implement one timing or the other, possibly
            dependent on \Fselect, \Fexecute, \Fload, and \Fstore. This bit
            primarily exists for the hardware to communicate to the debugger
            what will happen. Hardware may implement the bit fully writable, in
            which case the debugger has a little more control.

            Data load triggers with \Ftiming of 0 will result in the same load
            happening again when the debugger lets the core run. For data load
            triggers debuggers must first attempt to set the breakpoint with
            \Ftiming of 1.

            A chain of triggers that don't all have the same \Ftiming value
            will never fire (unless consecutive instructions match the
            appropriate triggers).

    <register name="Instruction Count" short="icount" address="0x7a1">
        This register is accessible as \Rtdataone when \Ftype is 3.

        {\bf Warning! \Ricount is just a proposal. So far nobody has commented
        on it, so it could very easily be removed or changed in the future.}

        Writing unsupported values to any field in this register results in the
        reset value being written instead. When a debugger wants to use a
        feature, it must write the appropriate value and then read back the
        register to determine whether it is supported.

        \begin{commentary} This trigger type is intended to be used as a single
        step that's useful both for external debuggers and for software monitor
        programs. As such it is not necessary to support \Fcount greater than
        1. The only two combinations of the mode bits that are useful in those
        scenarios are \Fu by itself, or \Fm, \Fh, \Fs, and \Fu all set.

        If the hardware limits \Fcount to 1, and changes mode bits instead of
        decrementing \Fcount, this register can be implemented with just 2
        bits. One for \Fu, and one for \Fm, \Fh, and \Fs tied together.  If
        only the external debugger or only a software monitor needs to be
        supported, a single bit is enough.

            When count is decremented to 0, the trigger fires. Instead of
            changing \Fcount from 1 to 0, it is also acceptable for hardware to
            clear \Fm, \Fh, \Fs, and \Fu. This allows \Fcount to be hard-wired
            to 1 if this register just exists for single step.
