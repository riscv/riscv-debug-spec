Software contains bugs, and to help find these bugs it is critical to have good
debugging tools. Unless a robust OS is running on a core, with convenient
access to it (eg. over a network interface), hardware support is required to
provide visibility into what is going on in that core.  This document outlines
how that support should be provided on RISC-V platforms.
