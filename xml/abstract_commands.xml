        \begin{steps}{This command gives the debugger access to CPU registers
        and allows it to execute the Program Buffer.
        If the command and all requested options are supported in the current state
	(see Section~\ref{abstractcommands}),
        it performs the following sequence of operations:}
        \item If \FacAccessregisterWrite is clear and \FacAccessregisterTransfer is set, then copy data from
            the register specified by \FacAccessregisterRegno into the {\tt arg0} region of
            {\tt data}, and perform any side effects that occur when this
            register is read from M-mode.
        \item If \FacAccessregisterWrite is set and \FacAccessregisterTransfer is set, then copy data from the
            {\tt arg0} region of {\tt data} into the register specified by
            \FacAccessregisterRegno, and perform any side effects that occur when this register
            is written from M-mode.
        \item If \FacAccessregisterAarpostincrement is set, increment \FacAccessregisterRegno.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \FacAccessregisterPostexec is set.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \FdmAbstractcsCmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure. If the failure is that the requested register
        does not exist in the hart, \FdmAbstractcsCmderr must be set to 3 (exception).

        Debug Modules must implement this command
        and must support read and write access to all GPRs when the selected hart is halted.
        Debug Modules may optionally support accessing other registers,
        or accessing registers when the hart is running.
        Each individual register (aside from GPRs) may be supported differently
        across read, write, and halt status.

        This command modifies {\tt arg0} only when a register is read. The
        other {\tt data} registers are not changed.

	For the Access Register Command, the \RdmCommand register (see Section~\ref{command})
	is formatted as follows:

        <field name="cmdtype" bits="31:24">
            This is 0 to indicate Access Register Command.
        </field>
        <field name="0" bits="23" />
        <field name="aarsize" bits="22:20">
            2: Access the lowest 32 bits of the register.

            3: Access the lowest 64 bits of the register.

            4: Access the lowest 128 bits of the register.

            If \FacAccessregisterAarsize specifies a size larger than the register's actual size,
            then the access must fail. If a register is accessible, then reads of \FacAccessregisterAarsize
            less than or equal to the register's actual size must be supported.

            This field controls the Argument Width as referenced in
            Table~\ref{tab:datareg}.
        </field>
        <field name="aarpostincrement" bits="19">
            0: No effect. This variant must be supported.

            1: After a successful register access, \FacAccessregisterRegno is incremented
            (wrapping around to 0). Supporting this variant is optional.
        </field>
        <field name="postexec" bits="18">
            0: No effect. This variant must be supported, and is the only
            supported one if \FdmAbstractcsProgbufsize is 0.

            1: Execute the program in the Program Buffer exactly once after
            performing the transfer, if any. Supporting this variant is
            optional.
        </field>
        <field name="transfer" bits = "17">
            0: Don't do the operation specified by \FacAccessregisterWrite.

            1: Do the operation specified by \FacAccessregisterWrite.

            This bit can be used to just execute the Program Buffer without
            having to worry about placing valid values into \FacAccessregisterAarsize or \FacAccessregisterRegno.
        </field>
        <field name="write" bits="16">
            When \FacAccessregisterTransfer is set:
            0: Copy data from the specified register into {\tt arg0} portion
               of {\tt data}.

            1: Copy data from {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data} into the
               specified register.
        </field>
        <field name="regno" bits="15:0">
          Number of the register to access, as described in
          Table~\ref{tab:regno}.
          \RcsrDpc may be used as an alias for PC if this command is
          supported on a non-halted hart.
        </field>
    </register>

    <register name="Quick Access">
        \begin{steps}{Perform the following sequence of operations:}
        \item If the hart is halted, the command  sets \FdmAbstractcsCmderr to ``halt/resume'' and does not continue.
        \item Halt the hart. If the hart halts for some other reason (e.g. breakpoint), the command
            sets \FdmAbstractcsCmderr to ``halt/resume'' and does not continue.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer. If an exception occurs, \FdmAbstractcsCmderr is set to ``exception''
            and the program buffer execution ends, but the quick access command continues.
        \item Resume the hart.
        \end{steps}

        Implementing this command is optional.

        This command does not touch the {\tt data} registers.

        <field name="cmdtype" bits="31:24">
            This is 1 to indicate Quick Access command.
        </field>
        <field name="0" bits="23:0" />
    </register>

    <register name="Access Memory">
        \begin{steps}{This command lets the debugger perform memory accesses,
            with the exact same memory view and permissions as the selected
            hart has. This includes access to hart-local memory-mapped
            registers, etc. The command performs the following sequence of
            operations:}
        \item Copy data from the memory location specified in {\tt arg1} into the
            {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data}, if \FacAccessregisterWrite is clear.
        \item Copy data from the {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data} into the
            memory location specified in {\tt arg1}, if \FacAccessregisterWrite is set.
        \item If \FacAccessmemoryAampostincrement is set, increment {\tt arg1}.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \FdmAbstractcsCmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An access may only fail if the hart,
        running M-mode code, might encounter that same failure when it attempts
        the same access.
        An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure.

        Debug Modules may optionally implement this command
        and may support read and write access to memory locations when the selected hart is running or halted.
        If this command supports memory accesses
        while the hart is running, it must also
        support memory accesses while the hart is halted.

            The encoding of \FacAccessmemoryAamsize was chosen to match \FdmSbcsSbaccess in \RdmSbcs.
        \end{commentary}

        This command modifies {\tt arg0} only when memory is read. It modifies
        {\tt arg1} only if \FacAccessmemoryAampostincrement is set.  The other {\tt data}
        registers are not changed.

            An implementation does not have to implement both virtual and
            physical accesses, but it must fail accesses that it doesn't
            support.

            0: Addresses are physical (to the hart they are performed on).

            1: Addresses are virtual, and translated the way they would be from
            M-mode, with \FcsrMcontrolMprv set.
