        \begin{steps}{This command gives the debugger access to CPU registers
        and allows it to execute the Program Buffer.
        It performs the following sequence of operations:}
        \item If \Fwrite is clear and \Ftransfer is set, then copy data from
            the register specified by \Fregno into the {\tt arg0} region of
            {\tt data}, and perform any side effects that occur when this
            register is read from M-mode.
        \item If \Fwrite is set and \Ftransfer is set, then copy data from the
            {\tt arg0} region of {\tt data} into the register specified by
            \Fregno, and perform any side effects that occur when this register
            is written from M-mode.
        \item If \Faarpostincrement is set, increment \Fregno.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \Fpostexec is set.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \Fcmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure. If the failure is that the requested register
        does not exist in the hart, \Fcmderr must be set to 3 (exception).

        Debug Modules must implement this command
        and must support read and write access to all GPRs when the selected hart is halted.
        Debug Modules may optionally support accessing other registers,
        or accessing registers when the hart is running.
        Each individual register (aside from GPRs) may be supported differently
        across read, write, and halt status.

            and the program buffer execution ends, but the quick access command continues.

    <register name="Access Memory">
        \begin{steps}{This command lets the debugger perform memory accesses,
            with the exact same memory view and permissions as the selected
            hart has. This includes access to hart-local memory-mapped
            registers, etc. The command performs the following sequence of
            operations:}
        \item Copy data from the memory location specified in {\tt arg1} into the
            {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data}, if \Fwrite is clear.
        \item Copy data from the {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data} into the
            memory location specified in {\tt arg1}, if \Fwrite is set.
        \item If \Faampostincrement is set, increment {\tt arg1}.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \Fcmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An access may only fail if the hart,
        running M-mode code, might encounter that same failure when it attempts
        the same access.
        An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure.

        Debug Modules may optionally implement this command
        and may support read and write access to memory locations when the selected hart is running or halted.
        If this command supports memory accesses
        while the hart is running, it must also
        support memory accesses while the hart is halted.

    <register name="Feature Discovery">
        This optional command provides access to a data structure that
        describes which abstract commands (full register contents) are
        supported for the hart currently selected by \Fhartsel. If it is
        implemented the structure must describe every implemented abstract
        command, except for the Feature Discovery command itself.

        The data structure consists of a series of 32-bit words.  The words at
        even indices consist of a sample supported command. The words at odd
        indices contain a mask that applies to the previous sample command. A
        command (full contents of \Rcommand) C is supported if and only if
        there is a $|sample|/$|mask| pair in the data structure where $(C
        \BitAnd |mask|) = (|sample| \BitAnd |mask|)$. See an example in
        Table~\ref{tab:command_discovery}.

        Because the CSR space is sparsely populated, it is allowed and
        recommended to list Access Register CSR commands as supported even
        though not every CSR exists.
