        \begin{steps}{This command gives the debugger access to CPU registers and program buffer.
        It performs the following sequence of operations:}
        \item Copy data from the register specified by \Fregno into the
            {\tt arg0} region of {\tt data}, if \Fwrite is clear and \Ftransfer is set.
        \item Copy data from the {\tt arg0} region of {\tt data} into the
            register specified by \Fregno, if \Fwrite is set and \Ftransfer is set.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \Fpostexec is set.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \Fcmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure.

        Debug Modules must implement this command
        and must support read and write access to all GPRs when the selected hart is halted.
        Debug Modules may optionally support accessing other registers,
        or accessing registers when the hart is running.
        If this command is
        supported for a register while the hart is running, it must also
        be supported for a register while the hart is halted.
        Each individual register (aside from GPRs) may be supported differently
        across read, write, and halt status.

            The encoding of \Fsize was chosen to match \Fsbaccess in \Rsbcs.

        \begin{steps}{Perform the following sequence of operations:}
        \item If the hart is halted, the command  sets \Fcmderr to \texttt{halt/resume} and does not continue.

            sets \Fcmderr to \texttt{halt/resume} and does not continue.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer. If an exception occurs, \Fcmderr is set to \texttt{exception}
            and the program buffer execution ends, but the quick access command continues.
