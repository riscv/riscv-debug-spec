        \begin{steps}{This command gives the debugger access to CPU registers
        and allows it to execute the Program Buffer.
        It performs the following sequence of operations:}
        \item If \FacAccessregisterWrite is clear and \FacAccessregisterTransfer is set, then copy data from
            the register specified by \FacAccessregisterRegno into the {\tt arg0} region of
            {\tt data}, and perform any side effects that occur when this
            register is read from M-mode.
        \item If \FacAccessregisterWrite is set and \FacAccessregisterTransfer is set, then copy data from the
            {\tt arg0} region of {\tt data} into the register specified by
            \FacAccessregisterRegno, and perform any side effects that occur when this register
            is written from M-mode.
        \item If \FacAccessregisterAarpostincrement and
            \FacAccessregisterTransfer are set, increment
            \FacAccessregisterRegno. \FacAccessregisterRegno may also be
            incremented if \FacAccessregisterAarpostincrement is set and
            \FacAccessregisterTransfer is clear.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \FacAccessregisterPostexec is set.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \FdmAbstractcsCmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure. If the failure is that the requested register
        does not exist in the hart, \FdmAbstractcsCmderr must be set to 3 (exception).

        Debug Modules must implement this command
        and must support read and write access to all GPRs when the selected hart is halted.
        Debug Modules may optionally support accessing other registers,
        or accessing registers when the hart is running.
        It is recommended that if one register in a group is accessible, then
        all registers in that group are accessible, but each individual
        register (aside from GPRs) may be supported differently across read,
        write, and halt status.

        Registers might not be accessible if they wouldn't be accessible by M
        mode code currently running. (E.g. {\tt fflags} might not be accessible
        when {\tt mstatus}.$|FS|$ is 0.) If this is the case, the debugger is
        responsible for changing state to make the registers accessible. The
        Core Debug Registers (Section~\ref{debreg}) should be accessible if
        abstract CSR access is implemented.

            If \FacAccessregisterAarsize specifies a size larger than the register's actual size,

            less than or equal to the register's actual size must be supported.

            sets \FdmAbstractcsCmderr to ``halt/resume'' and does not continue.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer.
            If an exception occurs, \FdmAbstractcsCmderr is set to
            ``exception,'' the Program Buffer execution ends, and the hart is
            halted with \FcsrDcsrCause set to 3.

    <register name="Access Memory">
        \begin{steps}{This command lets the debugger perform memory accesses,
            with the exact same memory view and permissions as the selected
            hart has. This includes access to hart-local memory-mapped
            registers, etc. The command performs the following sequence of
            operations:}
        \item Copy data from the memory location specified in {\tt arg1} into the
            {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data}, if \FacAccessregisterWrite is clear.
        \item Copy data from the {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data} into the
            memory location specified in {\tt arg1}, if \FacAccessregisterWrite is set.
        \item If \FacAccessmemoryAampostincrement is set, increment {\tt arg1}.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \FdmAbstractcsCmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An access may only fail if the hart,
        running M-mode code, might encounter that same failure when it attempts
        the same access.
        An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure.

        Debug Modules may optionally implement this command
        and may support read and write access to memory locations when the selected hart is running or halted.
        If this command supports memory accesses
        while the hart is running, it must also
        support memory accesses while the hart is halted.

            The encoding of \FacAccessmemoryAamsize was chosen to match \FdmSbcsSbaccess in \RdmSbcs.

        This command modifies {\tt arg0} only when memory is read. It modifies
        {\tt arg1} only if \FacAccessmemoryAampostincrement is set.  The other {\tt data}
        registers are not changed.
