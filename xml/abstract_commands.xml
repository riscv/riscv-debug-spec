        \begin{steps}{This command gives the debugger access to CPU registers and program buffer.
        It performs the following sequence of operations:}
        \item If \Fwrite is clear and \Ftransfer is set, then copy data from
            the register specified by \Fregno into the {\tt arg0} region of
            {\tt data}, and perform any side effects that occur when this
            register is read from M mode.
        \item If \Fwrite is set and \Ftransfer is set, then copy data from the
            {\tt arg0} region of {\tt data} into the register specified by
            \Fregno, and perform any side effects that occur when this register
            is written from M mode.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer, if \Fpostexec is set.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \Fcmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure. If the failure is that the requested register
        does not exist in the hart, \Fcmderr must be set to 3 (exception).

        Debug Modules must implement this command
        and must support read and write access to all GPRs when the selected hart is halted.
        Debug Modules may optionally support accessing other registers,
        or accessing registers when the hart is running.
        If this command is
        supported for a register while the hart is running, it must also
        be supported for a register while the hart is halted.
        Each individual register (aside from GPRs) may be supported differently
        across read, write, and halt status.

            If \Faarsize specifies a size larger than the register's actual size,
            then the access must fail. If a register is accessible, then reads of \Faarsize
            less than or equal to the register's actual size must be supported.

        \item If the hart is halted, the command  sets \Fcmderr to \texttt{halt/resume} and does not continue.
        \item Halt the hart. If the hart halts for some other reason (e.g. breakpoint), the command
            sets \Fcmderr to \texttt{halt/resume} and does not continue.
        \item Execute the Program Buffer. If an exception occurs, \Fcmderr is set to \texttt{exception}
            and the program buffer execution ends, but the quick access command continues.
        \item Resume the hart.

    <register name="Access Memory">
        \begin{steps}{This command lets the debugger perform memory accesses,
            with the exact same memory view and permissions as the selected
            hart has. This includes access to hart-local memory-mapped
            registers, etc. The command performs the following sequence of
            operations:}
        \item Copy data from the memory location specified in {\tt arg1} into the
            {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data}, if \Fwrite is clear.
        \item Copy data from the {\tt arg0} portion of {\tt data} into the
            memory location specified in {\tt arg1}, if \Fwrite is set.
        \item Increment {\tt arg1}, if \Faampostincrement is set.
        \end{steps}

        If any of these operations fail, \Fcmderr is set and none of the
        remaining steps are executed. An access may only fail if the hart,
        running M mode code, might encounter that same failure when it attempts
        the same access.
        An implementation may detect an upcoming
        failure early, and fail the overall command before it reaches the step
        that would cause failure.

        Debug Modules may optionally implement this command
        and may support read and write access to memory locations when the selected hart is running or halted.
        If this command supports memory accesses
        while the hart is running, it must also
        support memory accesses while the hart is halted.
