            Explains why Debug Mode was entered.

            When there are multiple reasons to enter Debug Mode in a single
            cycle, hardware should set \FcsrDcsrCause to the cause with the highest
            priority.

            1: An {\tt ebreak} instruction was executed. (priority 3)

            2: The Trigger Module caused a breakpoint exception. (priority 4)

            3: The debugger requested entry to Debug Mode using \FdmDmcontrolHaltreq.
            (priority 1)

            4: The hart single stepped because \FcsrDcsrStep was set. (priority 0, lowest)

            5: The hart halted directly out of reset due to \Fresethaltreq. It
            is also acceptable to report 3 when this happens. (priority 2)

            6: The hart halted because it's part of a halt group. (priority 5,
            highest) Harts may report 3 for this cause instead.
