    <register name="Debug Module Status" short="dmstatus" address="0x11">
        The address of this register will not change in the future, because it
        contains \Fversion.  It has changed from version 0.11 of this spec.

        This register reports status for the overall debug module
        as well as the currently selected harts, as defined in \Fhasel.

        Harts are nonexistent if they will never be part of this system, no
        matter how long a user waits. Eg. in a simple single-hart system only
        one hart exists, and all others are nonexistent.

        Harts are unavailable if they might exist/become available at a later
        time.  Eg. in a multi-hart system some might temporarily be powered
        down, or a system might support hot-swapping harts.

      When {\tt devtreevalid} is set, reading this register returns bits 31:0
      of the Device Tree address. Reading the other {\tt devtreeaddr}
      registers returns the upper bits of the address.

      When system bus mastering is implemented, this must be an
      address that can be used with the System Bus Access module. Otherwise,
      this must be an address that can be used to access the
      Device Tree from the hart with ID 0.

      If {\tt devtreevalid} is 0, then the {\tt devtreeaddr} registers
      hold identifier information which is not
      further specified in this document.

      The Device Tree itself is described in the RISC-V Privileged
      Specification.
