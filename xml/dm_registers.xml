        This register controls the overall Debug Module

[[hartsel]]
(((hartsel)))
        Throughout this document we refer to {hartsel}, which is {dmcontrol-hartselhi}
        combined with {dmcontrol-hartsello}. While the spec allows for 20 {hartsel} bits,
        an implementation may choose to implement fewer than that. The actual
        width of {hartsel} is called `HARTSELLEN`. It must be at least 0
        and at most 20. A debugger should discover `HARTSELLEN` by writing
        all ones to {hartsel} (assuming the maximum size) and reading back the
        value to see which bits were actually set. Debuggers must not change
        {hartsel} while an abstract command is executing.

        [NOTE]
        ====
        There are separate {dmcontrol-setresethaltreq} and {dmcontrol-clrresethaltreq} bits so that
        it is possible to write {dm-dmcontrol} without changing the halt-on-reset
        request bit for each selected hart, when not all selected harts have
        the same configuration.
        ====

        On any given write, a debugger may only write 1 to at most one of the
        following bits: {dmcontrol-resumereq}, {dmcontrol-hartreset}, {dmcontrol-ackhavereset},
        {dmcontrol-setresethaltreq}, and {dmcontrol-clrresethaltreq}. The others must be written 0.

[[resethaltreq]]
(((resethaltreq)))
        {resethaltreq} is an optional internal bit of per-hart state that cannot be
        read, but can be written with {dmcontrol-setresethaltreq} and {dmcontrol-clrresethaltreq}.

[[keepalive]]
(((keepalive)))
        {keepalive} is an optional internal bit of per-hart state. When it is
        set, it suggests that the hardware should attempt to keep the hart
        available for the debugger, e.g. by keeping it from entering a
        low-power state once powered on. Even if the bit is implemented,
        hardware might not be able to keep a hart available. The bit is
        written through {dmcontrol-setkeepalive} and
        {dmcontrol-clrkeepalive}.

        For forward compatibility, {dmstatus-version} will always be readable when bit 1
        ({dmcontrol-ndmreset}) is 0 and bit 0 ({dmcontrol-dmactive}) is 1.

        <!-- Fields that apply to all selected hart(s) -->
        <field name="haltreq" bits="31" access="WARZ" reset="-">
            Writing 0 clears the halt request bit for all currently selected
            harts. This may cancel outstanding halt requests for those harts.

            Writing 1 sets the halt request bit for all currently selected
            harts. Running harts will halt whenever their halt request bit is
            set.

            ack bit for those harts.

            writes 0 to deassert the reset signal.

            While this bit is 1, the debugger must not change which harts are
            selected.

            If this feature is not implemented, the bit always stays 0, so

        Any successful system bus read updates `sbdata`. If the width of
        the read access is less than the width of `sbdata`, the contents of
        the remaining high bits may take on any value.

        If either {sbcs-sberror} or {sbcs-sbbusyerror} isn't 0 then accesses do nothing.

        If the bus manager is busy then accesses set {sbcs-sbbusyerror}, and don't do
        anything else.

        Writes to this register start the following:

            . Set {sbcs-sbbusy}.
            . Perform a bus write of the new value of `sbdata` to `sbaddress`.
            . If the write succeeded and {sbcs-sbautoincrement} is set,
            increment `sbaddress`.
            . Clear {sbcs-sbbusy}.

        Reads from this register start the following:

            . "Return" the data.
            . Set {sbcs-sbbusy}.
            . If {sbcs-sbreadondata} is set:

                .. Perform a system bus read from the address contained in
