    <register name="Debug Module Status" short="dmstatus" address="0x11">
        The address of this register will not change in the future, because it
        contains \Fversion.  It has changed from version 0.11 of this spec.

        This register reports status for the overall debug module
        as well as the currently selected harts, as defined in \Fhasel.

        Harts are nonexistent if they will never be part of this system, no
        matter how long a user waits. Eg. in a simple single-hart system only
        one hart exists, and all others are nonexistent.

        Harts are unavailable if they might exist/become available at a later
        time.  Eg. in a multi-hart system some might temporarily be powered
        down, or a system might support hot-swapping harts.
