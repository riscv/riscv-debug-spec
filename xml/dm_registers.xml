\label{hartsel}
\index{hartsel}
        Throughout this document we refer to \Fhartsel, which is \FdmDmcontrolHartselhi
        combined with \FdmDmcontrolHartsello. While the spec allows for 20 \Fhartsel bits,
        an implementation may choose to implement fewer than that. The actual
        width of \Fhartsel is called {\tt HARTSELLEN}. It must be at least 0
        and at most 20. A debugger should discover {\tt HARTSELLEN} by writing
        all ones to \Fhartsel (assuming the maximum size) and reading back the
        value to see which bits were actually set. Debuggers must not change
        \Fhartsel while an abstract command is executing.

        \begin{commentary}
        There are separate \FdmDmcontrolSetresethaltreq and \FdmDmcontrolClrresethaltreq bits so that
        it is possible to write \RdmDmcontrol without changing the halt-on-reset
        request bit for each selected hart, when not all selected harts have
        the same configuration.
        \end{commentary}

        On any given write, a debugger may only write 1 to at most one of the
        following bits: \FdmDmcontrolResumereq, \FdmDmcontrolHartreset, \FdmDmcontrolAckhavereset,
        \FdmDmcontrolSetresethaltreq, and \FdmDmcontrolClrresethaltreq. The others must be written 0.

\label{resethaltreq}
\index{resethaltreq}
        \Fresethaltreq is an optional internal bit of per-hart state that cannot be
        read, but can be written with \FdmDmcontrolSetresethaltreq and \FdmDmcontrolClrresethaltreq.

\label{keepalive}
\index{keepalive}
        \Fkeepalive is an optional internal bit of per-hart state. When it is
        set, it suggests that the hardware should attempt to keep the hart
        available for the debugger, e.g. by keeping it from entering a
        low-power state once powered on. Even if the bit is implemented,
        hardware might not be able to keep a hart available. The bit is
        written through \FdmDmcontrolSetkeepalive and
        \FdmDmcontrolClrkeepalive.

        For forward compatibility, \FdmDmstatusVersion will always be readable when bit 1
        (\FdmDmcontrolNdmreset) is 0 and bit 0 (\FdmDmcontrolDmactive) is 1.

        <field name="haltreq" bits="31" access="WARZ" reset="-">
            Writing 0 clears the halt request bit for all currently selected
            harts. This may cancel outstanding halt requests for those harts.

            Writing 1 sets the halt request bit for all currently selected
            harts. Running harts will halt whenever their halt request bit is
            set.

            This optional field writes the reset bit for all the currently

            writes 0 to deassert the reset signal.

            While this bit is 1, the debugger must not change which harts are
            selected.

            If this feature is not implemented, the bit always stays 0, so
            after writing 1 the debugger can read the register back to see if
            the feature is supported.
