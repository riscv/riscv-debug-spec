<registers name="Trigger Registers" prefix="CSR_" label="trigger">
    The trigger registers, except \RcsrMscontext, \RcsrScontext, and \RcsrHcontext, are only accessible in machine
    and Debug Mode to prevent untrusted user code from causing entry into Debug
    Mode without the OS's permission.

    In this section XLEN means MXLEN when in M-mode, and DXLEN when in Debug
    Mode. On systems where those values of XLEN can differ, this is handled
    as follows.
    Fields retain their values regardless of XLEN, which only affects where
    in the register these fields appear (e.g. \FcsrTdataOneType). Some fields
    are wider when XLEN is 64 than when it is 32 (e.g.
    \FcsrTextraThirtytwoSvalue). The high bits in such fields retain their
    value but are not readable when XLEN is 32.
    A modification of a register when XLEN is 32 clears any inaccessible bits
    in that register.

    <register name="Trigger Select" short="tselect" address="0x7a0">
        This register determines which trigger is accessible through the other
        trigger registers. It is optional if no triggers are implemented.  The
        set of accessible triggers must start at 0, and be contiguous.

        This register is \warl.
        Writes of values greater than or equal to the number of supported
        triggers may result in a different value in this register than what was
        written or may point to a trigger where \FcsrTdataOneType=0.
        To verify that what they wrote is a valid index, debuggers can
        read back the value and check that \RcsrTselect holds what they wrote
        and read \RcsrTdataOne to see that \FcsrTdataOneType is non-zero.

        Since triggers can be used both by Debug Mode and M-mode, the external
        debugger must restore this register if it modifies it.

        Address and data trigger implementation are heavily dependent on how
        the processor core is implemented. To accommodate various
        implementations, execute, load, and store address/data triggers may fire at
        whatever point in time is most convenient for the implementation.
        The debugger may request specific timings as described in \FcsrMcontrolTiming.
        Table~\ref{tab:hwbp_timing} suggests timings for the best user experience.

        A chain of triggers that don't all have the same \FcsrMcontrolTiming
        value will never fire. That means to implement the suggestions in
        Table~\ref{tab:hwbp_timing}, both timings should be supported on load
        address triggers.

        This trigger type may be limited to address comparisons (\FcsrMcontrolSelect is
        always 0) only. If that is the case and masking is not supported (match
        values 4, 5, 12, 13), then \RcsrTdataTwo must be able to
        hold all valid virtual addresses but it need not be capable of holding
        other values.

        The Privileged Spec says that breakpoint exceptions that occur on
        instruction fetches, loads, or stores update the {\tt tval} CSR
        with either zero or the faulting virtual address.  The faulting
        virtual address for an mcontrol trigger with \FcsrMcontrolAction=0 is the
        address being accessed and which caused that trigger to fire.
        If multiple mcontrol triggers are chained then the faulting
        virtual address is the address which caused any of the chained
        triggers to fire.

        If \RcsrTextraThirtytwo or \RcsrTextraSixtyfour are implemented for this
        trigger, it only matches when the conditions set there are satisfied.

            Data load triggers with \FcsrMcontrolTiming of 0 will result in the same load
            happening again when the debugger lets the hart run. For data load
            triggers, debuggers must first attempt to set the breakpoint with
            \FcsrMcontrolTiming of 1.

            An implementation must support the value of 0, but all other values
            are optional. When an implementation supports address triggers
            (\FcsrMcontrolSelect=0), it is recommended that those triggers
            support every access size that the hart supports, as well as for
            every instruction size that the hart supports.

            Implementations such as RV32D or RV64V are able to perform loads
            and stores that are wider than XLEN. Custom extensions may also
            support instructions that are wider than XLEN. Because
            \RcsrTdataTwo is of size XLEN, there is a known limitation that
            data value triggers (\FcsrMcontrolSelect=1) can only be supported
            for access sizes up to XLEN bits.  When an implementation supports
            data value triggers (\FcsrMcontrolSelect=1), it is recommended
            that those triggers support every access size up to XLEN that the
            hart supports, as well as for every instruction length up to XLEN
            that the hart supports.

            A trigger chain starts on the first trigger with $|chain|=1$ after
            a trigger with $|chain|=0$, or simply on the first trigger if that
            has $|chain|=1$. It ends on the first trigger after that which has
            $|chain|=0$. This final trigger is part of the chain. The action
            on all but the final trigger is ignored.  The action on that final
            trigger will be taken if and only if all the triggers in the chain
            match at the same time.

            Debuggers should not terminate a chain with a trigger with a
            different type. It is undefined when exactly such a chain fires.

            Because \FcsrMcontrolChain affects the next trigger, hardware must zero it in
            writes to \RcsrMcontrol that set \FcsrTdataOneDmode to 0 if the next trigger has
            \FcsrTdataOneDmode of 1.
            In addition hardware should ignore writes to \RcsrMcontrol that set
            \FcsrTdataOneDmode to 1 if the previous trigger has both \FcsrTdataOneDmode of 0 and
            \FcsrMcontrolChain of 1. Debuggers must avoid the latter case by checking
            \FcsrMcontrolChain on the previous trigger if they're writing \RcsrMcontrol.

            Implementations that wish to limit the maximum length of a trigger
            chain (eg. to meet timing requirements) may do so by zeroing
            \FcsrMcontrolChain in writes to \RcsrMcontrol that would make the chain too long.

        This register is accessible as \RcsrTdataOne when \FcsrTdataOneType is 6.

        Implementing this trigger as described here requires that
        \FcsrTinfoVersion is 1 or higher, which in turn means \RcsrTinfo must
        be implemented.

        This replaces mcontrol in newer implementations and serves to provide additional
        functionality.

        Address and data trigger implementation are heavily dependent on how
        the processor core is implemented. To accommodate various
        implementations, execute, load, and store address/data triggers may fire at
        whatever point in time is most convenient for the implementation.

        Table~\ref{tab:hwbp_timing} suggests timings for the best user experience.
        The underlying principle is that firing just before the instruction
        gives a user more insight, so is preferable. However, depending on the
        instruction and conditions, it might not be possible to evaluate the
        trigger until the instruction has partially executed. In that case it is
        better to let the instruction retire before the trigger fires, to avoid
        extra memory accesses which might affect the state of the system.

        A chain of triggers must only fire if every trigger in the chain was
        matched by the same instruction.

        This trigger type may be limited to address comparisons (\FcsrMcontrolSixSelect is
        always 0) only. If that is the case and masking is not supported (match
        values 4, 5, 12, 13), then \RcsrTdataTwo must be able to
        hold all valid virtual addresses but it need not be capable of holding
        other values.

        The Privileged Spec says that breakpoint exceptions that occur on
        instruction fetches, loads, or stores update the {\tt tval} CSR
        with either zero or the faulting virtual address.  The faulting
        virtual address for an mcontrol6 trigger with \FcsrMcontrolSixAction=0 is the
        address being accessed and which caused that trigger to fire.
        If multiple mcontrol6 triggers are chained then the faulting
        virtual address is the address which caused any of the chained
        triggers to fire.

        \begin{steps}{In implementations that support \FcsrMcontrolSixMatch mode 1 (NAPOT), not all
        NAPOT ranges may be supported.  All NAPOT ranges between $2^{1}$ and $2^{maskmax6}$
        are supported where maskmax6 $\geq$ 1.  The value of maskmax6 can be determined
        by the debugger via the following sequence:}
        \item Set \FcsrMcontrolSixMatch=1.
        \item Read \FcsrMcontrolSixMatch. If it is not 1 then NAPOT matching is not supported.
        \item Write all ones to \RcsrTdataTwo.
        \item Read \RcsrTdataTwo. The value of maskmax6 is the index of the most significant 0 bit plus 1.
        \end{steps}

        If \RcsrTextraThirtytwo or \RcsrTextraSixtyfour are implemented for this
        trigger, it only matches when the conditions set there are satisfied.

        \begin{commentary}
        \FcsrMcontrolSixUncertain and \FcsrMcontrolSixUncertainen exist to
        accommodate systems where not every memory access is fully observed by
        the Trigger Module. Possible examples include data values in far AMOs,
        and the address/data/size of accesses by instructions that perform
        multiple memory accesses, such as vector, push, and pop instructions.

        While the uncertain mechanism exists to deal with these situations, it
        can lead to an unusable number of false positives. Users will get a much
        better debug experience if the TM does have perfect visibility into the
        details of every memory access.

            An implementation must support the value of 0, but all other values
            are optional. When an implementation supports address triggers
            (\FcsrMcontrolSixSelect=0), it is recommended that those triggers
            support every access size that the hart supports, as well as for
            every instruction size that the hart supports.

            Implementations such as RV32D or RV64V are able to perform loads
            and stores that are wider than XLEN. Custom extensions may also
            support instructions that are wider than XLEN. Because
            \RcsrTdataTwo is of size XLEN, there is a known limitation that
            data value triggers (\FcsrMcontrolSixSelect=1) can only be supported
            for access sizes up to XLEN bits.  When an implementation supports
            data value triggers (\FcsrMcontrolSixSelect=1), it is recommended
            that those triggers support every access size up to XLEN that the
            hart supports, as well as for every instruction length up to XLEN
            that the hart supports.

            A trigger chain starts on the first trigger with $|chain|=1$ after
            a trigger with $|chain|=0$, or simply on the first trigger if that
            has $|chain|=1$. It ends on the first trigger after that which has
            $|chain|=0$. This final trigger is part of the chain. The action
            on all but the final trigger is ignored.  The action on that final
            trigger will be taken if and only if all the triggers in the chain
            match at the same time.

            Debuggers should not terminate a chain with a trigger with a
            different type. It is undefined when exactly such a chain fires.

            Because \FcsrMcontrolSixChain affects the next trigger, hardware must zero it in
            writes to \RcsrMcontrolSix that set \FcsrTdataOneDmode to 0 if the next trigger has
            \FcsrTdataOneDmode of 1.
            In addition hardware should ignore writes to \RcsrMcontrolSix that set
            \FcsrTdataOneDmode to 1 if the previous trigger has both \FcsrTdataOneDmode of 0 and
            \FcsrMcontrolSixChain of 1. Debuggers must avoid the latter case by checking
            \FcsrMcontrolSixChain on the previous trigger if they're writing \RcsrMcontrolSix.

            Implementations that wish to limit the maximum length of a trigger
            chain (eg. to meet timing requirements) may do so by zeroing
            \FcsrMcontrolSixChain in writes to \RcsrMcontrolSix that would make the chain too long.

        \begin{steps}{This trigger matches when:}
            \item
                An instruction retires after having been fetched in a privilege
                mode where the trigger is enabled.
                This explicitly includes {\em x}\/RET instructions.
            \item A trap is taken from a privilege mode where the trigger is enabled.
                This explicitly includes traps taken due to interrupts.
        \end{steps}

        If more than one of the above events occur during a single instruction
        execution, the trigger still only matches once for that instruction.

        \begin{commentary}
            For use in single step, icount must match for traps where the
            instruction will not be reexecuted after the handler, such as
            illegal instructions that are emulated by privileged software and
            the instruction being emulated never retires. Ideally, icount would
            not match for traps where the instruction will later be retried by
            the handler, such as page faults where privileged software modifies
            the page tables and returns to the faulting instruction which
            ultimately retires. Trying to distinguish the two cases leads to
            complex rules, so instead the rule is simply that all traps match.
            See also Section~\ref{stepIcount}.
        \end{commentary}

        When \FcsrIcountCount is greater than 1 and the trigger matches, then
        \FcsrIcountCount is decremented by 1.

        When \FcsrIcountCount is 1 and the trigger matches, then \FcsrIcountPending
        becomes set. In addition \FcsrIcountCount will become 0 unless it is
        hard-wired to 1.

        The only exception to the above is when the instruction the trigger matched on is a
        write to the icount trigger. In that case \FcsrIcountPending might or might
        not become set if \FcsrIcountCount was 1. Afterwards \FcsrIcountCount
        contains the newly written value.

        When \FcsrIcountCount is 0 it stays at 0 until explicitly written.

        When \FcsrIcountPending is set, the trigger fires just
        before any further instructions are executed in a mode where the
        trigger is enabled. As the trigger fires, \FcsrIcountPending is
        cleared. In addition, if \FcsrIcountCount is hard-wired to 1 then \FcsrIcountM,
        \FcsrIcountS, \FcsrIcountU, \FcsrIcountVs, and \FcsrIcountVu are all
        cleared.

        If the trigger fires with \FcsrIcountAction=0 then zero is written to the
        {\tt tval} CSR on the breakpoint trap.

        \begin{commentary}
        The intent of \FcsrIcountPending is to cleanly handle the case where
        \FcsrIcountAction is 0, \FcsrIcountM is 0, \FcsrIcountU is 1,
        \FcsrIcountCount is 1, and the U-mode instruction being executed
        causes a trap into M-mode. In that case we want the entire M-mode
        handler to be executed, and the debug trap to be taken before the
        next U-mode instruction.
        \end{commentary}

        \begin{commentary}
        This trigger type is intended to be used as a single step for software
        monitor programs or native debug.  Systems that support multiple
        privilege modes that want to debug software running in lower privilege
        modes don't need to support \FcsrIcountCount greater than 1.

        This trigger may fire on any of the interrupts configurable in \Rmie
        (described in the Privileged Spec) or the NMI. The interrupts to fire on are
        configured by setting the same bit in \RcsrTdataTwo as would be set in
        \Rmie to enable the interrupt.

        Hardware may only support a subset of interrupts for this trigger.  A
        debugger must read back \RcsrTdataTwo after writing it to confirm the
        requested functionality is actually supported.

        The trigger only fires if the hart takes a trap because of the
        interrupt. (E.g.\  it does not fire when a timer interrupt occurs but that
        interrupt is not enabled in \Rmie.)

        When the trigger fires, all CSRs are updated for the interrupt trap as defined by the
        Privileged Spec, and the requested action is taken just before the
        first instruction of the trap handler is executed.
        If the trigger fires with \FcsrItriggerAction=0 then zero is written to the

    <register name="Exception Trigger" short="etrigger" address="0x7a1">
        This register is accessible as \RcsrTdataOne when \FcsrTdataOneType is 5.

        This trigger may fire on up to XLEN of the Exception Codes defined in
        \Rmcause (described in the Privileged Spec, with Interrupt=0). Those
        causes are configured by writing the corresponding bit in \RcsrTdataTwo.
        (E.g.\  to trap on an illegal instruction, the debugger sets bit 2 in
        \RcsrTdataTwo.)

        Hardware may support only a subset of exceptions. A debugger must read
        back \RcsrTdataTwo after writing it to confirm the requested functionality
        is actually supported.

        When the trigger fires, all CSRs are updated for the exception as defined by the
        Privileged Spec, and the requested action is taken just before the
        first instruction of the trap handler is executed.
        If the trigger fires with \FcsrEtriggerAction=0 then zero is written to the
        {\tt tval} CSR on the breakpoint trap (see ~\ref{sec:nativetrigger}).

        If \RcsrTextraThirtytwo or \RcsrTextraSixtyfour are implemented for this
        trigger, it only matches when the conditions set there are satisfied.

    <register name="External Trigger" short="tmexttrigger" address="0x7a1">
        This register is accessible as \RcsrTdataOne when \FcsrTdataOneType is 7.

        This trigger fires when any selected TM external trigger input
        signals.  Up to 16 TM external
        trigger inputs coming from other blocks outside the TM,
        (e.g. signaling an hpmcounter overflow) can be selected.  Hardware
        may support none or just a few TM external trigger inputs
        (starting with TM external trigger input 0 and continuing
        sequentially).  Unsupported inputs are hardwired to be inactive.

        If the trigger fires with \FcsrTmexttriggerAction=0 then zero is written to the
        {\tt tval} CSR on the breakpoint trap.  This trigger fires
        asynchronously but it is subject to delegation by medeleg[3] like
        the other triggers.

        The TM external trigger input can signal when the trigger is prevented
        from firing due to one of the mechanisms in section ~\ref{sec:nativetrigger}.
        An implementation may either ignore the signal altogether when it cannot
        fire (dropping the trigger event) or it may hold the action as pending
        and fire the trigger once it is legal to do so.
