        This register determines which trigger is accessible through the other
        trigger registers. The set of accessible triggers must start at 0, and
        be contiguous.

        Writes of values greater than or equal to the number of supported
        triggers may result in a different value in this register than what was
        written.  Debuggers should read back the value to confirm that what
        they wrote was a valid index.

        Since triggers can be used both by Debug Mode and M Mode, the debugger
        must restore this register if it modifies it.

        Address and data trigger implementation are heavily dependent on how
        the processor core is implemented. To accommodate various
        implementations, execute, load, and store address/data triggers may fire at
        whatever point in time is most convenient for the implementation.
        The debugger may request specific timings as described in \Ftiming.
        Table~\ref{tab:hwbp_timing} suggests timings for the best user experience.

            Most hardware will only implement one timing or the other, possibly
            dependent on \Fselect, \Fexecute, \Fload, and \Fstore. This bit
            primarily exists for the hardware to communicate to the debugger

            Data load triggers with \Ftiming of 0 will result in the same load
            happening again when the debugger lets the hart run. For data load

        \begin{commentary} This trigger type is intended to be used as a single

        programs. For that case it is not necessary to support \Fcount greater
        than

        If the hardware limits \Fcount to 1, and changes mode bits instead of
        decrementing \Fcount, this register can be implemented with just 2
        bits. One for \Fu, and one for \Fm and \Fs tied together.  If
        only the external debugger or only a software monitor needs to be
        supported, a single bit is enough.
