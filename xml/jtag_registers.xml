          reason to expect that the outstanding DMI transaction will never

    <register name="Debug Module Interface Access" short="dmi" address="0x11"

        This register allows access to the Debug Module Interface (DMI).

        In Update-DR, the DTM starts the operation specified in \Fop unless the
        current status reported in \Fop is sticky.

        In Capture-DR, the DTM updates \Fdata with the result from that
        operation, updating \Fop if the current \Fop isn't sticky.

        See Section~\ref{dmiaccess} and Table~\ref{tab:memread} for examples
        of how this is used.

        \begin{commentary}
        The still-in-progress status is sticky to accommodate debuggers that
        batch together a number of scans, which must all be executed or stop as
        soon as there's a problem.

        For instance a series of scans may write a Debug Program and execute
        it.  If one of the writes fails but the execution continues, then the
        Debug Program may hang or have other unexpected side effects.
        \end{commentary}

        <field name="address" bits="abits+33:34" access="R/W" reset="0">
            Address used for DMI access. In Update-DR this value is used
            to access the DM over the DMI.
        </field>
        <field name="data" bits="33:2" access="R/W" reset="0">
            The data to send to the DM over the DMI during Update-DR, and
            the data returned from the DM as a result of the previous operation.
        </field>
        <field name="op" bits="1:0" access="R/W" reset="0">
            When the debugger writes this field, it has the following meaning:

            0: Ignore \Fdata and \Faddress. (nop)

            Don't send anything over the DMI during Update-DR.
            This operation should never result in a busy or error response.
            The address and data reported in the following Capture-DR
            are undefined.

            1: Read from \Faddress. (read)

            2: Write \Fdata to \Faddress. (write)

            3: Reserved.

            When the debugger reads this field, it means the following:

            0: The previous operation completed successfully.

            1: Reserved.

            2: A previous operation failed.  The data scanned into \Rdmi in
            this access will be ignored.  This status is sticky and can be
            cleared by writing \Fdmireset in \Rdtmcs.

            This indicates that the DM itself responded with an error.
            There are no specified cases in which the DM would
            respond with an error, and DMI is not required to support
            returning errors.

            3: An operation was attempted while a DMI request is still in
            progress. The data scanned into \Rdmi in this access will be
            ignored. This status is sticky and can be cleared by writing
            \Fdmireset in \Rdtmcs. If a debugger sees this status, it
            needs to give the target more TCK edges between Update-DR and
            Capture-DR. The simplest way to do that is to add extra transitions
            in Run-Test/Idle.
