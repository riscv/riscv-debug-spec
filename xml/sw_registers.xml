<registers name="Virtual Core Debug Registers" prefix="VIRT_">
    A virtual register is one that doesn't exist directly in the hardware, but
    that the debugger exposes as if it does. Debug software should implement
    them, but hardware can skip this section. Virtual registers exist to give
    users access to functionality that's not part of standard debuggers without
    requiring them to carefully modify debug registers while the debugger is
    also accessing those same registers.

     <register name="Privilege Level" short="priv" address="virtual">
        Users can read this register to inspect the privilege level that
        the hart was running in when the hart halted.
        Users can write this register to change the privilege level that
        the hart will run in when it resumes.

        This register contains \FcsrDcsrPrv from \RcsrDcsr, but in a place that the user
        is expected to access. The user should not access \RcsrDcsr directly,
        because doing so might interfere with the debugger.

        <field name="prv" bits="1:0" access="R/W" reset="0">
            Contains the privilege level the hart was operating in when Debug
            Mode was entered. The encoding is described in Table
            \ref{tab:privlevel}, and matches the privilege level encoding from
            the Privileged Spec. A user can write this
            value to change the hart's privilege level when exiting Debug Mode.
